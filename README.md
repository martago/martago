### Welcome ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Martago, a Senior Software Developer from Germany. 

My main focus is definitely backend development in spring-boot.
But I like also to develop the frontend too :)

### My projects
I use mainly mostly for codesnippets. If I have to start a new projects, then sometimes it's easier to start with a template :)

So 99% of the project's that I have is for that reason.

But right now, I'm developing a open-source solution to a specific problem, that I need to fix.

### ðŸ“« How to reach me?
Only via GitHub :) I like my privacy.
